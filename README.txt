High dynamic range imaging (HDRI) is an emerging field that has the potential to cause a great scientific and technological impact. This field is large and complex, with non-trivial relations to many different areas, such as image synthesis, computer vision, video and image processing, digital photography, special effects among others. For the above reasons, HDRI has been extensively researched over the past years and, consequently, the related scientific literature is vast. As an indication that the field is reaching maturity, tutorials and books on HDRI appeared. Moreover, this new resource has already reached interested practitioners in various application areas. In this whitepaper, we do not aim at covering the whole field of high dynamic range imaging and its applications, instead, we aim to cover the basic principles behind HDRI using debevec HDR approach and focus on resolving the HDR problem arising, both theoretical and practical. That is, the reconstruction of high dynamic range images from regular low dynamic range images using Matlab.
